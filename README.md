  WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options (inquirer checkbox?)
  THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a
  notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains
  which license the application is covered under
  WHEN a link in Table of Contents is clicked
  THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
